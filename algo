algorithm
  - place p number of mines randomly on board of size m*n
  - do the numbering for all cells (update the proximity-matrix)
  - for every move of user (x,y), keep updating the visible-matrix 

data structures 
  - variables p,q holding max size of board
  - mine coordinates list. A list of pair of coordinates for each mine
  - proximity-matrix
  - visibility-matrix

proximity matrix creation techniques
  - for each element, process its all neighbours

  - for each "direction" process each element coming

  - for each mine, process its neighbours.
