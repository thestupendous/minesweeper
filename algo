algorithm
  - place n number of mines randomly on board of size p*q
  - do the numbering for all cells (update the proximity-matrix)
  - for every move of user (x,y), keep updating the visible-matrix 

data structures 
  - variables p,q holding max size of board
  - mine coordinates list. A list of pair of coordinates for each mine
  - proximity-matrix
  - visibility-matrix
