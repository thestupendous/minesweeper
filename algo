algorithm
  - place p number of mines randomly on board of size m*n
  - do the numbering for all cells (update the proximity-matrix)
  - for every move of user (x,y), keep updating the visible-matrix 

data structures 
  - variables p,q holding max size of board
  - mine coordinates list. A list of pair of coordinates for each mine
  - proximity-matrix
  - visibility-matrix

proximity matrix creation techniques
  - for each element, process its all neighbours

  - for each "direction" process each element coming

  - for each mine, process its neighbours.

tracking to the mine (updating visibility board)
  - if coordinates provided by the user are directly at a mine, game quits
  - if coordinates are at a cell that has value zero in proximity matrix,
		- make it visible,
		- keep traversing in all four directions and make them visible untill you keep hitting zeroes.
		when you hit a number > 0, make it visible, stop
  - if coordinates are at a cell that has number > 0, make it visible
